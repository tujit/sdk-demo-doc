user group map represent the relation between a user (sub) and the user group. Actually the user is a member of the user group with or without roles.

cidaas provides standard user groups with groupIds `CIDAAS_ADMINS` and `CIDAAS_USERS`. Default roles are per se mapped to CIDAAS_USERS group as described in examples below. Since all users do belong to `CIDAAS_USERS` these roles can be considered as default_roles.
